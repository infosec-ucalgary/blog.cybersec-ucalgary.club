Founded in 2019 as the Information Security Club, CYBERSEC is the largest Computer Science (CPSC) student group at the University of Calgary, with a community of over 2,000 members. We are a not-for-profit, student-run organization dedicated to building an inclusive and collaborative hub for students and aspiring cybersecurity professionals at every stage of their journey.

CYBERSEC exists to connect curiosity with opportunity. We provide a central platform where students can learn, experiment, and collaborate within the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. Our organization is committed to delivering high-quality, accessible programming at no cost to our members, including technical lectures, hands-on workshops, speaker series, fireside chats, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and networking events.

We are also the proud home of magpieCTF, our flagship annual capture-the-flag competition. Open to participants of all skill levels, magpieCTF brings together students and security enthusiasts from across the community to tackle real-world security challenges while competing for thousands of dollars in prizes.

The Magpies Patch is the official CYBERSEC blog and serves as an information hub for our members. Here, you’ll find updates and insights on current happenings in cybersecurity locally, nationally, and globally, along with announcements about upcoming CYBERSEC workshops, CTFs, speaker sessions, and events hosted with our local partners. The blog is designed to keep our community informed, engaged, and inspired, while highlighting the ideas, experiences, and achievements of our members.

Interested in getting involved? Just join the Official CYBERSEC Discord and go from there. Whether you’re here to learn, compete, write, or connect, there’s a place for you in the flock.
